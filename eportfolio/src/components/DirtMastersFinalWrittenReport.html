However, they face challenges impacting their efficiency, productivity, and market reach. This report provides an in-depth analysis of these issues and proposes recommendations designed to enhance Dirt Masters&#39; operations and online presence. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The main challenges identified are rooted in their planning, bidding, and estimating processes and data storage management. The adoption of AGTEK&#39;s software subscription service is recommended to streamline these crucial procedures, substantially saving time and improving overall productivity. Simultaneously, the transition to Google Cloud for data storage is recommended to address the concerns of data loss and security, offering a scalable solution for the future growth of Dirt Masters.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Additionally, Dirt Masters needs to expand its digital presence in order to reach and be seen in bigger, more populated cities. To increase the company&#39;s online visibility, we advise implementing search engine optimization strategies, sponsoring website links on Google, and using social media platforms. It is suggested that the company&#39;s website be updated to follow contemporary UX design principles and include a more expert point-of-contact system. These enhancements can enhance customer service interactions and leave a better impression on prospective customers. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The suggested changes will cost money up front, but they are planned as strategic investments to increase profitability, secure data, and improve Dirt Masters&#39; online presence. The provided implementation schedule takes into account the available resources and capabilities and guarantees a seamless transition with little disruption. The Dirt Masters team&#39;s dedication to embracing new tools, workflows, and adapting to these changes is essential to the success of these suggestions.</span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.gl9xl5d49smf"><span class="c10">Background/Introduction</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With over 30 years of experience in the building and excavation industries, Dirt Masters is a seasoned general contractor. Dirt Masters has established a reputation for providing top-notch services in site construction, excavation, underground utility installation, site development, and septic system installation. The company&#39;s operational reach spans Washington and Oregon. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The company&#39;s success can be attributed to its unwavering dedication to providing excellent customer service and the breadth of its knowledge. As a business, Dirt Masters does more than just perform construction and excavation work; it gives each customer&#39;s project individualized attention to make sure every task is in line with the customer&#39;s goals and expectations. The caliber of the professionals who make up the Dirt Masters team reflects this focus on the needs of the customer. The business only hires professionals who are not only skilled in their field but also enthusiastic about helping clients. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Over time, Dirt Masters has expanded its services, transforming from a company solely focused on dirt work to a versatile general contractor. Its range of services is tailored to accommodate the needs of both commercial and residential clients. Today, the company&#39;s market areas are diverse, covering commercial constructions, geothermal installation, materials provision, subdivisions, transportation of aggregate, excavation and utilities, septic systems, sewer connections, water remediation, and land clearing. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">At the helm of Dirt Masters&#39; operations are Mari and Ron Campuzano, the owners of the company. As of 2023, Dirt Masters has expanded its team, with Jeff Higgens coming on board to provide IT and project management support. In addition, Bella Campuzano has been brought into the fold, taking on significant management responsibilities, and potentially expanding the company in terms of marketing. While Dirt Masters employs several contractors for excavation work, the company has been grappling with the challenge of providing its employees with year-round work. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Dirt Masters&#39; operational footprint spans several communities in Western Washington and Oregon, including Portland, Gresham, Troutdale, Clackamas, Vancouver, and more. While the company&#39;s service area is expansive, it has faced challenges in fully tapping into its potential market reach, particularly in the larger cities. Despite offering excellent services, Dirt Masters is hard to access through online searches. Many potential customers may not even be aware of the company due to its limited online visibility. This has been a significant factor in constraining Dirt Masters&#39; growth trajectory. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In addition to market reach issues, Dirt Masters also encounters challenges surrounding its planning/bidding/estimating processes and data storage. The company has been utilizing PlanSwift software for its crucial operations, but PlanSwift lacks certain capabilities, including a 3D modeling interface and the ability to read design files (DWG). This has resulted in extended hours spent on project bids. However, the alternative solution, AGTEK, has emerged as a potential upgrade with its ability to read CAD files and provide a more streamlined bidding process. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Regarding data storage, Dirt Masters currently stores its data primarily on hard drives and a Google Drive, but these solutions lack the optimized security and organization that the company requires. There are concerns about data security, especially considering the potential for hacking. Moreover, the company&#39;s current client list, held in QuickBooks, may be at risk of loss during the transition away from PlanSwift.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This report presents a detailed analysis of these challenges, as well as comprehensive recommendations for overcoming them. The report aims to help Dirt Masters optimize its operations, secure crucial data, and lay a solid foundation for sustained growth and continued success in the years to come.</span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.dcppo0lb6y5a"><span class="c10">Research</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c12">This section provides a comprehensive overview of the research conducted on Dirt Masters, including an analysis of the external business environment, internal strengths and weaknesses, financial analysis, and technical aspects.

The company&#39;s close relationships with the local community, as well as its sponsorship of local events, provide a competitive advantage in connecting with potential clients.

One of the problems that Dirt Masters is currently facing is their data storage. Storing files primarily on hard drives and transitioning from one laptop to another can lead to potential data loss, and it&#39;s an inefficient method of collaboration.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Based on our analysis, we recommend transitioning to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for data storage and sharing. The choice of GCP offers several significant advantages:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><ol class="c7 lst-kix_wf1d8ntjrheu-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Scalability: </span><span class="c2">GCP provides virtually unlimited storage space that scales with your business.

Files can be accessed, edited, and shared from anywhere, improving productivity and reducing delays.</span></li><li class="c1 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Security: </span><span class="c2">GCP offers robust security features to keep your data safe. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, and administrators can control access at varying levels, ensuring sensitive information remains confidential. GCP also provides automated backups and disaster recovery solutions to protect against data loss.</span></li><li class="c1 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Cost-Effectiveness: </span><span class="c2">With GCP, you only pay for the storage you use. This flexibility allows Dirt Masters to effectively manage costs while benefiting from extensive cloud storage capabilities.</span></li></ol><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The transition to GCP should be carefully planned and executed to ensure data security and continuity of operations. Initial steps should involve conducting training for team members on using GCP, followed by the gradual migration of files to the cloud platform. It&#39;s also crucial to establish data organization practices and access controls during this transition.</span></p><h3 class="c18" id="h.qvwfh2x3bnie"><span class="c20 c16">Section 2: Estimation Software - Transition towards AGTEK via Subscription Model</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In analyzing Dirt Masters&#39; bidding process, it was noted that a significant amount of time was being spent on takeoffs and estimations - upwards of 20-40 hours per project. Furthermore, the current software, PlanSwift, lacks essential features that AGTEK offers, such as a 3D modeling interface and the ability to read DWG files, leading to further inefficiencies.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Our recommendation is to adopt AGTEK&#39;s software through a subscription model. Key benefits of this approach include:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><ol class="c7 lst-kix_somg7n5e7isi-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Efficiency: </span><span class="c2">AGTEK can read CAD files, enabling quicker bid preparation. By transitioning from PlanSwift to AGTEK, it&#39;s estimated that takeoff time could be reduced to 6-10 hours per project, potentially saving over 30 hours per bid. This time savings could significantly improve productivity and allow for a higher volume of bids.</span></li><li class="c1 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Functionality: </span><span class="c2">AGTEK provides a 3D modeling interface, which PlanSwift lacks. This feature can be beneficial in visualizing projects and creating more accurate estimates.</span></li><li class="c1 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Cost-Effective: </span><span class="c2">Opting for the subscription model allows Dirt Masters to trial AGTEK without a significant initial investment. If the software does not meet the company&#39;s needs, it can be more easily discontinued than if purchased outright.</span></li></ol><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The implementation of AGTEK should start with a trial period, during which the team should be trained and given time to adapt to the new software. During this trial period, a gradual shift of ongoing projects to AGTEK would help identify any potential issues early on. At the end of the trial, a thorough evaluation of AGTEK&#39;s performance should be conducted before deciding on its continued use. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Due to current financial circumstances, it is best that Dirt Masters purchase the subscription software of AGTEK in comparison to the full licensing. This is a more affordable option at a per year estimate of $10,335. The full quote of the AGTEK subscription is available in the Appendix. It may be beneficial for Dirt Masters to purchase the full license at a later date due to the long-term financial benefits. It is also good to note that the 12 month underground added to gradework annual trial promo might not exist in the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c27">Current estimation of added value:</span><span class="c2"><br>Current situation:&#8203; Inputting 30 bids a year, winning 10 bids.

One of the major concerns we witnessed was the fact that the company website only appeared after specifying Washougal, Washington in the Google search engine. We recommend adopting search engine optimization tactics to boost the company&rsquo;s rank for searches in nearby cities, given that Washougal is one of the smaller cities in said area. The major threat is </span><span class="c12">that the Portland-</span><span class="c2">, Clackamas-, and other major city-based companies are taking the clients that are searching for services in those higher populated areas, which are even currently experiencing waves of property development&ndash;and Washougal alone is notorious for being more to the side. Thus, one gameplay to boost search engine presence in the bigger cities is to include those city names throughout the website, such as by posting on the blog about work done there. Other techniques could include adopting local ad service, or sponsoring your webpage link on Google, to acquire a higher search ranking, as well as posting ads on major city blogs, such as portlandrealestateblog.com; and even utilizing social media. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Also, in terms of online presence, we recommend the company enhance its customer service orientation by improving the website. The website displays several problems in terms of user experience, such as phone numbers and email addresses being inconsistent, broken links and buttons, and dead-end web page flow. More details in this regard can be found in the Appendix. We recommend updating the website&rsquo;s front end to accommodate modern UX design principles, especially given that the webpage may be the first impression a client has on the company. We also recommend gaining insight from employees or previous clients on where the website could use design improvements and comparing it to your local competitors. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Additionally, in terms of customer service and impression tactics, we finally recommend adopting a professionalized point-of-contact system. The current point-of-contact, as per the phone number online and on logos, would be Mr. Campuzano, however, the directing of clients to a personal cell phone has become an atypical, unmodernized practice. We recommend adopting a more organized approach by setting up an automated voicemail system, and a consistent phone-answering strategy, which especially may be helpful in keeping stronger client relationships and record upon contracting. </span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.hmvkt63nmz4m"><span class="c10">Implementation Timeline</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c16">&gt;&gt; Week 1 &ndash; 3</span></p><ol class="c7 lst-kix_k1dezcbdvnzu-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c16">Training on GCP: </span><span class="c2">Mari arranges for the team to receive training on how to use GCP.

They should also continuously monitor the SEO performance, the effectiveness of local ad services and sponsored links, the user experience of the website, and social media engagement. Adjustments should be made accordingly to ensure the continuous growth and online presence of Dirt Masters.</span></li></ol><h2 class="c15" id="h.6efu8ex7udut"><span class="c10">Conclusion</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In conclusion, over the 10 weeks we have been working with Mari and the rest of the clients at Dirt Masters, they have proven to be an exceptional local business within the Washougal, WA area. Their specialization is in site construction, excavation, installation of underground utilities, site development, and septic system installation. With over 30+ years of knowledge and expertise, if they continue their drive and willingness to improve their business operations, they will succeed against other local competitors within the dirt management industry. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The issues Dirt Masters is currently facing &ndash; notably the inefficiencies in the planning/bidding/estimating process and data storage management &ndash; present challenges but also opportunities for improvement and growth.
